## QuakePortedToRoblox

### The purpose of this project.

- We are looking for people to contribute on a project that the purpose is to
be able to use the [Quake](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quake) Physics on [Roblox](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roblox), we as a community that seeks this are very far,
and a lot of contribution is needed.

### How do we collect the math the game uses in order to port?

- Thanks to [Quake III Arena](https://github.com/id-Software/Quake-III-Arena) source code, we are able to replicate some stuff
that the game has, this gives us a very big help, credits to id-Software.
